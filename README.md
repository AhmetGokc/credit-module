Project Overview
The Credit Module Project is a RESTful API that provides functionality for managing loans. It allows administrators and customers to perform operations such as creating loans, listing loans, viewing loan installments, and making payments. The project is built with Spring Boot, Spring Security, and uses a file-based H2 Database for persistent data storage.

Features
Create Loan: Create a new loan for a customer with validations on interest rate, installments, and credit limits.
List Loans: List loans for a specific customer.
View Installments: Retrieve installments for a specific loan.
Make Payments: Pay loan installments with rules for penalties and discounts based on payment timing.

Role-Based Access:
Admin Role: Access to all APIs for all customers.
Customer Role: Access restricted to APIs for their own loans.
